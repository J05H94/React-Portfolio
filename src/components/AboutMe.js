            <p>Hello there! I'm Josh, an eager software developer with a strong foundation in programming and problem solving. I recently completed an immersive job boot camp, where I gained first hand experience in developing applications. During my time at the boot camp, I honed my skills in a wide array of programming languages such as JavaScript, SQL and Node. I also gained practical experience in front-end and back-end development, using frameworks like React and Express.</p>
